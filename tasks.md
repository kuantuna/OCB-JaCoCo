## 2. Find out what coveralls:report is (some Maven plugin that may be saving coverage reports to coveralls.io) (potential task: build a similar pluing for codecov.io)


Link of the github repo of the plugin: https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin

Yes, basically what it does is that it submits the generated code coverage reports to Coveralls web service.

## 3. Find difference between jacoco:report and jacoco:report-integration

As it pointed out in the documentation, report-integration goal is "same as report, but provides default values suitable for integration-tests"

## 4. What does "gradle jacoco:report" (this may just save files as "mvn â€¦ jacoco")

Yes, this is used to generate HTML, Xml and CSV reports of Jacoco coverage data.

## 5. Check if one can upload coverage to Sonar

Yes, one can upload coverage to Sonar as can be seen in here: https://tomgregory.com/how-to-measure-code-coverage-using-sonarqube-and-jacoco/
